We call it Digital Health Management. Our comprehensive suite of Digital Health Management solutions for care management, advocacy, and navigation help organizations forge more meaningful connections with members, across their healthcare journey.
Wellframe was founded to counter a pressing industry problem: the healthcare system has struggled to find ways to support people in between care settings, at scale. We believe health plans are in the best position to advocate for their members as they navigate their health and care, but know that technology alone can’t help us achieve this ambition. That’s why our team of physicians, clinicians, public health experts, data scientists, engineers, and healthcare industry experts ensure our patented technology works in service of the person-to-person connections that make healthcare work best.
Wellframe helps healthcare organizations support every aspect of health beyond the four walls of care delivery. We provide care transformation services, a patented engagement platform, clinical programs that support the clinical and social determinants of health, and rigorous measurement.
Wellframe translates evidence-based, peer-reviewed guidelines and literature into an interactive daily checklist delivered to members through the Wellframe mobile app. As members engage with the Wellframe app, their data is shared in real-time with their care team through the care team dashboard, which utilizes advanced algorithms to generate early intervention alerts. With secure two-way messaging, Wellframe facilitates long-term, trusted relationships between patients and care teams. Role Overview
The Data Science team at Wellframe brings cutting-edge technologies to solve problems at the intersection of healthcare and technology. We work with large, multi-source datasets that include medical claims, mobile app, messaging and care management data. Our mission is to gain 360-degree insights into members’ lives both within and outside of the healthcare system, and to use these insights to build a better digital healthcare product that is tailored for specific member populations.
We are seeking a Data Scientist to contribute to a growing body of insights from claims and platform usage data. This individual will play a critical role in measuring the value Wellframe generates for our customers as well as their members. S/he will contribute to member segmentation as well as insights generated from the mobile app usage and the care team dashboard. Finally, s/he will help identify members that stand to benefit from particular interventions, as well as care team performance.

Interested in working for a human-centered technology company that prides itself on using modern tools and technologies? Want to be surrounded by intensely curious and innovative thinkers who push one another to come up with the best solutions possible?
Modeling ourselves after the 1904 World’s Fair, which brought innovation to the region, 1904labs is seeking top talent in St. Louis to bring innovation and creativity to help us continue to grow.
We help enterprise organizations turn their digital transformation ideas into reality. Working in a team-based labs model, using our #HCDAgile methodology, we strive to innovatively solve problems while keeping humans at the center.
The Role
As a Data Scientist with 1904labs, you will be working with other data scientists, data engineers, and developers to provide analytical and data science services to clients. You will leverage the clients’ data assets to answer business questions using best practices and innovative approaches. This will mean employing various analytics tools (ex: Tableau, Power BI), data science tools (ex: Python, Apache Spark) and analysis techniques (ex: statistical analysis, unsupervised/supervised learning). Our goal is to create reusable, automated solutions, so once a solution is tested and verified, you will work with development teams to implement the algorithm as a scalable, hosted service, and monitor it in production to ensure it remains accurate.
We’re looking for an experienced and creative data scientist or analytics professional who can conceptualize a project from start to finish, identifying the appropriate data and methodologies to use. Our Data Scientists work with open-source analysis and machine learning packages and libraries, so this position involves building custom utilities from open-source resources in languages such as Python. In this role, you will own and share technical solutions with both technical and non-technical stakeholders across multiple teams both internally and with external clients.
Responsibilities
Perform data analysis to understand the right combinations of data to meet objectives

Basic Qualifications
Proficient knowledge of linear algebra, statistics, probability, and numerical analysis.
Comfortable working with data to perform operations such as Extract-Transform-Load, data manipulation for analysis, data visualization, etc.
2+ years experience with data analysis techniques such as hypothesis testing, time series analysis, computational simulation, exploratory analysis, clustering, etc.
Proficient with Machine Learning Analysis: Execute, evaluate, and apply various models such as logistic regression, random forests/decision tree, nearest neighbor, neural net, support vector machine, an ensemble of multiple models, etc.
Programming: Proficient coding in an object-oriented language suited for machine learning systems such as Python (not reliant on GUI-based systems to execute analysis) for the purpose of cleaning, manipulating, visualizing, and analyzing data

Desired Skills
Experience with software engineering and developing deployable API services
Drive to learn new technologies and frameworks
Experience with browser-based interactive computational environments (like Jupyter Notebook).
Tools: Spark, Pandas, SciKit-Learn, TensorFlow, Keras, SQL
Desires to understand the business needs and translate that into requirements.
Enjoys explaining the analysis process and translating results into actionable insights for both technical and non-technical audiences.
Experience working collaboratively with engineering teams to achieve project deliverables.
Comfort in an agile development environment (eg. writing stories, participating in workshops, sprint planning and retros)

With secure two-way messaging, Wellframe facilitates long-term, trusted relationships between patients and care teams. Role Overview
The Data Science team at Wellframe brings cutting-edge technologies to solve problems at the intersection of healthcare and technology. We work with large, multi-source datasets that include medical claims, mobile app, messaging and care management data. Our mission is to gain 360-degree insights into members’ lives both within and outside of the healthcare system, and to use these insights to build a better digital healthcare product that is tailored for specific member populations.
We are seeking a Data Scientist to contribute to a growing body of insights from claims and platform usage data. This individual will play a critical role in measuring the value Wellframe generates for our customers as well as their members. S/he will contribute to member segmentation as well as insights generated from the mobile app usage and the care team dashboard. Finally, s/he will help identify members that stand to benefit from particular interventions, as well as care team performance.

With secure two-way messaging, Wellframe facilitates long-term, trusted relationships between patients and care teams. Role Overview
The Data Science team at Wellframe brings cutting-edge technologies to solve problems at the intersection of healthcare and technology. We work with large, multi-source datasets that include medical claims, mobile app, messaging and care management data.

Programming: Proficient coding in an object-oriented language suited for machine learning systems such as Python (not reliant on GUI-based systems to execute analysis) for the purpose of cleaning, manipulating, visualizing, and analyzing data

Desired Skills
Experience with software engineering and developing deployable API services
Drive to learn new technologies and frameworks
Experience with browser-based interactive computational environments (like Jupyter Notebook).
Tools: Spark, Pandas, SciKit-Learn, TensorFlow, Keras, SQL

With secure two-way messaging, Wellframe facilitates long-term, trusted relationships between patients and care teams. Role Overview
The Data Science team at Wellframe brings cutting-edge technologies to solve problems at the intersection of healthcare and technology. We work with large, multi-source datasets that include medical claims, mobile app, messaging and care management data.

4.6","At Wellframe, a HealthEdge company, we reimagine healthcare relationships through a new approach that uses high-tech to deliver the high-touch support people need, when and where they need it. We call it Digital Health Management. Our comprehensive suite of Digital Health Management solutions for care management, advocacy, and navigation help organizations forge more meaningful connections with members, across their healthcare journey.
Wellframe was founded to counter a pressing industry problem: the healthcare system has struggled to find ways to support people in between care settings, at scale. We believe health plans are in the best position to advocate for their members as they navigate their health and care, but know that technology alone can’t help us achieve this ambition. That’s why our team of physicians, clinicians, public health experts, data scientists, engineers, and healthcare industry experts ensure our patented technology works in service of the person-to-person connections that make healthcare work best.
Wellframe helps healthcare organizations support every aspect of health beyond the four walls of care delivery. We provide care transformation services, a patented engagement platform, clinical programs that support the clinical and social determinants of health, and rigorous measurement.
Wellframe translates evidence-based, peer-reviewed guidelines and literature into an interactive daily checklist delivered to members through the Wellframe mobile app. As members engage with the Wellframe app, their data is shared in real-time with their care team through the care team dashboard, which utilizes advanced algorithms to generate early intervention alerts. With secure two-way messaging, Wellframe facilitates long-term, trusted relationships between patients and care teams. Role Overview
The Data Science team at Wellframe brings cutting-edge technologies to solve problems at the intersection of healthcare and technology. We work with large, multi-source datasets that include medical claims, mobile app, messaging and care management data. Our mission is to gain 360-degree insights into members’ lives both within and outside of the healthcare system, and to use these insights to build a better digital healthcare product that is tailored for specific member populations.
We are seeking a Data Scientist to contribute to a growing body of insights from claims and platform usage data. This individual will play a critical role in measuring the value Wellframe generates for our customers as well as their members. S/he will contribute to member segmentation as well as insights generated from the mobile app usage and the care team dashboard. Finally, s/he will help identify members that stand to benefit from particular interventions, as well as care team performance.

With secure two-way messaging, Wellframe facilitates long-term, trusted relationships between patients and care teams. Role Overview
The Data Science team at Wellframe brings cutting-edge technologies to solve problems at the intersection of healthcare and technology. We work with large, multi-source datasets that include medical claims, mobile app, messaging and care management data.

Wellframe translates evidence-based, peer-reviewed guidelines and literature into an interactive daily checklist delivered to members through the Wellframe mobile app. As members engage with the Wellframe app, their data is shared in real-time with their care team through the care team dashboard, which utilizes advanced algorithms to generate early intervention alerts. With secure two-way messaging, Wellframe facilitates long-term, trusted relationships between patients and care teams. Role Overview
The Data Science team at Wellframe brings cutting-edge technologies to solve problems at the intersection of healthcare and technology. We work with large, multi-source datasets that include medical claims, mobile app, messaging and care management data.

Our comprehensive suite of Digital Health Management solutions for care management, advocacy, and navigation help organizations forge more meaningful connections with members, across their healthcare journey.
Wellframe was founded to counter a pressing industry problem: the healthcare system has struggled to find ways to support people in between care settings, at scale. We believe health plans are in the best position to advocate for their members as they navigate their health and care, but know that technology alone can’t help us achieve this ambition. That’s why our team of physicians, clinicians, public health experts, data scientists, engineers, and healthcare industry experts ensure our patented technology works in service of the person-to-person connections that make healthcare work best.
Wellframe helps healthcare organizations support every aspect of health beyond the four walls of care delivery. We provide care transformation services, a patented engagement platform, clinical programs that support the clinical and social determinants of health, and rigorous measurement.
Wellframe translates evidence-based, peer-reviewed guidelines and literature into an interactive daily checklist delivered to members through the Wellframe mobile app. As members engage with the Wellframe app, their data is shared in real-time with their care team through the care team dashboard, which utilizes advanced algorithms to generate early intervention alerts. With secure two-way messaging, Wellframe facilitates long-term, trusted relationships between patients and care teams. Role Overview
The Data Science team at Wellframe brings cutting-edge technologies to solve problems at the intersection of healthcare and technology. We work with large, multi-source datasets that include medical claims, mobile app, messaging and care management data. Our mission is to gain 360-degree insights into members’ lives both within and outside of the healthcare system, and to use these insights to build a better digital healthcare product that is tailored for specific member populations.
We are seeking a Data Scientist to contribute to a growing body of insights from claims and platform usage data. This individual will play a critical role in measuring the value Wellframe generates for our customers as well as their members. S/he will contribute to member segmentation as well as insights generated from the mobile app usage and the care team dashboard. Finally, s/he will help identify members that stand to benefit from particular interventions, as well as care team performance.
