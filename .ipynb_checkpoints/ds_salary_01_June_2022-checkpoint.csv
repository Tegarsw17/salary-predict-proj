Programming: Proficient coding in an object-oriented language suited for machine learning systems such as Python (not reliant on GUI-based systems to execute analysis) for the purpose of cleaning, manipulating, visualizing, and analyzing data

Desired Skills
Experience with software engineering and developing deployable API services
Drive to learn new technologies and frameworks
Experience with browser-based interactive computational environments (like Jupyter Notebook).
Tools: Spark, Pandas, SciKit-Learn, TensorFlow, Keras, SQL

3.7","We started Bloom Institute of Technology because we believe that the “traditional” model of higher education is broken. Every year, people as young as 17 years old take on tens of thousands of dollars in student debt and pray that the education they’re investing in will land them on a job on the other side.
‍
Unfortunately, traditional colleges and universities have no incentive to ensure their graduates get hired – they get paid regardless.
‍
At BloomTech, we believe there is a better way to approach education.

Instead of asking our students to bet on us, we bet on them first. This paradigm-shifting model allows us to align the incentives of the school with the incentives of our students – and we all win when our graduates succeed.
‍
We’re in this together.

If that sounds exciting to you, let’s talk. Our success depends on building teams who can challenge each other's assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we don’t just accept differences – we celebrate them. BloomTech welcomes a diverse pool of applicants, including those from historically marginalized groups and non-traditional backgrounds who can appreciate the diverse student communities that we serve and are looking to grow into. This includes women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, individuals who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, veterans, and people from different socioeconomic backgrounds.

Wellframe was founded to counter a pressing industry problem: the healthcare system has struggled to find ways to support people in between care settings, at scale. We believe health plans are in the best position to advocate for their members as they navigate their health and care, but know that technology alone can’t help us achieve this ambition.

Wellframe translates evidence-based, peer-reviewed guidelines and literature into an interactive daily checklist delivered to members through the Wellframe mobile app. As members engage with the Wellframe app, their data is shared in real-time with their care team through the care team dashboard, which utilizes advanced algorithms to generate early intervention alerts. With secure two-way messaging, Wellframe facilitates long-term, trusted relationships between patients and care teams. Role Overview
The Data Science team at Wellframe brings cutting-edge technologies to solve problems at the intersection of healthcare and technology. We work with large, multi-source datasets that include medical claims, mobile app, messaging and care management data.

114,Data Scientist/Visualization Specialist,Employer Provided Salary:$75K - $90K,-1,ZevRoss Spatial Analysis,"We are looking for a full-time data scientist/visualization specialist to work with the ZevRoss Spatial Analysis (ZRSA) team to transform, visualize, and communicate data for a wide range of innovative projects and clients. This position could be filled by a junior-, mid- or senior- level candidate and can be local in Ithaca or fully remote. This position is open to candidates qualified to work in the United States and is ineligible for visa sponsorship.
The ideal candidate would be someone with experience in data analysis and visualization with both non-geographic and geographic data. Skills in design are a plus.
We are prioritizing candidates with R experience but those with other software backgrounds (SAS, Stata, Python) will be considered.
What You Will Do:
Make sense of data. In other words, really think about the data and the story the data can tell.
Work with (and tame!) often messy data from a wide variety of sources—this includes, for example, Excel, JSON, CSV, databases.
Process data into meaningful structures so that it can be communicated in graphics, maps, and dashboards. Propose, create, and iterate data visualizations for a diversity of formats—from dynamic views on public websites to graphics for scientific papers and beyond.
Work with the ZRSA team to develop and complete dozens of projects per year, often focused on environmental and health topics.
Prepare static and interactive data visualizations.
Work with clients to realize their vision for data analysis and visualization, often shepherding a project from start to finish.
An example of a real project the Data Analyst might work on
For many years we have worked with a public health research organization. On their behalf we often create a combination of static and interactive charts and static and interactive maps. We tend to use R (ggplot2, highcharter), highcharts.js and D3.js for these. We also often create a larger interactive, data-driven web application for them and may programatically create a series of reports with Rmarkdown – perhaps one for each state, or one for each country.
In order to produce all these products we work directly with the client to determine the full set of materials required. In some cases, this might also involve some super-quick proof of concept charts to give the client some ideas. Generally, the client might provide 5-10 different input datasets in CSV and Excel – some of which need cleaning and many need to be joined/merged together. Each of the different products requires a different set of technical skills and each might require a different data input.
On a project like this, the Data Scientist/Visualization Specialist is expected to organize and process the data, propose visualization and design options, create visualizations or work with our software engineer to dynamically display data on the web. They will also project manage, by communicating with the client, keeping track of deliverables and GitHub issues and iterating to realize the client’s goals.
Required experience for all candidates
Proven experience with data management and analysis software, preferably R. We would expect all applicants to know how to programmatically read data, join tables and restructure data.
Experience with data visualization. At its most basic, this would be preparing plots with ggplot2 or other tools to highlight data. The candidate must be able to create data visualizations with a programming language.
Strong organizational skills. This is a truly important skill. Our projects often involve hundreds of GitHub issues with alterations to deliverables and other requests and these need to be carefully organized and addressed.
Strong communication skills in English
Qualifications for the junior-level position
This list of qualifications is for guidance but there is no strict delineation between junior-, mid- and senior-level. More experience in one area might offset less experience in another.
Junior-level qualifications include all qualifications listed above for “all candidates” plus:
1-3 years of experience analyzing and visualizing data
Experience with Git/GitHub (or Bitbucket) preferably with a record of commits
Qualifications for the mid- or senior-level position
This list of qualifications is for guidance but there is no strict delineation between junior-, mid- and senior-level. More experience in one area might offset less experience in another.
Mid- and Senior-level qualifications include all qualifications listed above for Junior candidates plus:
More than 3 years of experience analyzing and visualizing data
Significant programming experience. In R this might mean experience with, for example, purrr, haven, DT, leaflet/tmap, sf, data.table, tidyr packages.
Experience working with geographic data
Experience working with databases such as PostgreSQL and some experience writing SQL
Experience that would strengthen your application
We can benefit from a variety of technical skills. None of these are required, but if you have any they will help your application.
User experience (UX/UI), wireframing or prototyping (in for example Figma)
Experience with CSS
Experience developing R packages
Data journalism
Experience developing R/Shiny applications
Experience working with AWS or other cloud services and/or experience working with Docker
JavaScript experience (D3, React, etc.)
Tableau, PowerBI or related experience
Design products such as Photoshop and Illustrator
Some statistical experience. For example, experience running regression or random forest models.
Design skills would also strengthen your application
We would love to find someone with an eye for design. Data visualization is a key component of this role and default ggplot2 charts are often not good enough! We create custom static and interactive data visualizations for clients so someone with some design experience (Adobe, Figma etc) would be helpful, but it’s not required.
Expected salary

About Quora:
The vast majority of human knowledge is still not on the internet. Most of it is trapped in the form of experience in people's heads, or buried in books and papers that only experts can access. More than a billion people use the internet, yet only a tiny fraction contribute their knowledge to it. We want to democratize access to knowledge of all kinds — from politics to painting, cooking to coding, etymology to experiences — so if someone out there knows something, anyone else can learn it. Our mission is to share and grow the world's knowledge, and we're building a world-class team to help us achieve this mission.
About the Team:
Unsurprisingly, then, the Data Team is highly empowered at Quora, helping navigate complexity and influencing product and company strategy directly. Quora's outsized commitment to data is visible in everything we do, from our rigor-driven experimentation processes to the backgrounds of our leaders (including many Product Managers and the Head of Product being former full-time data scientists). With this emphasis on data and empirics, we aim to balance rigor and pragmatism, searching for scrappy solutions in pursuit of our mission. In joining Quora's strong data team, you'll both benefit from and work to advance our culture of rational decision making.

In this role, you will deliver data-driven insights to guide our business strategy and extract untapped value in our platform by developing a deep understanding of our advertisers and users. Quora has a wide range of rich data, giving you ample room for exploration and creativity. For more about our work, see Quora's Data blog at https://data.quora.com/.

Extract actionable insights from broad, open-ended questions to influence sales and product strategy and drive roadmap decisions
Analyze data to understand the root causes of metric movements and uncover growth opportunities

We call it Digital Health Management. Our comprehensive suite of Digital Health Management solutions for care management, advocacy, and navigation help organizations forge more meaningful connections with members, across their healthcare journey.
Wellframe was founded to counter a pressing industry problem: the healthcare system has struggled to find ways to support people in between care settings, at scale. We believe health plans are in the best position to advocate for their members as they navigate their health and care, but know that technology alone can’t help us achieve this ambition. That’s why our team of physicians, clinicians, public health experts, data scientists, engineers, and healthcare industry experts ensure our patented technology works in service of the person-to-person connections that make healthcare work best.
Wellframe helps healthcare organizations support every aspect of health beyond the four walls of care delivery. We provide care transformation services, a patented engagement platform, clinical programs that support the clinical and social determinants of health, and rigorous measurement.
Wellframe translates evidence-based, peer-reviewed guidelines and literature into an interactive daily checklist delivered to members through the Wellframe mobile app. As members engage with the Wellframe app, their data is shared in real-time with their care team through the care team dashboard, which utilizes advanced algorithms to generate early intervention alerts. With secure two-way messaging, Wellframe facilitates long-term, trusted relationships between patients and care teams. Role Overview
The Data Science team at Wellframe brings cutting-edge technologies to solve problems at the intersection of healthcare and technology. We work with large, multi-source datasets that include medical claims, mobile app, messaging and care management data. Our mission is to gain 360-degree insights into members’ lives both within and outside of the healthcare system, and to use these insights to build a better digital healthcare product that is tailored for specific member populations.
We are seeking a Data Scientist to contribute to a growing body of insights from claims and platform usage data. This individual will play a critical role in measuring the value Wellframe generates for our customers as well as their members. S/he will contribute to member segmentation as well as insights generated from the mobile app usage and the care team dashboard. Finally, s/he will help identify members that stand to benefit from particular interventions, as well as care team performance.

That’s why our team of physicians, clinicians, public health experts, data scientists, engineers, and healthcare industry experts ensure our patented technology works in service of the person-to-person connections that make healthcare work best.
Wellframe helps healthcare organizations support every aspect of health beyond the four walls of care delivery. We provide care transformation services, a patented engagement platform, clinical programs that support the clinical and social determinants of health, and rigorous measurement.
Wellframe translates evidence-based, peer-reviewed guidelines and literature into an interactive daily checklist delivered to members through the Wellframe mobile app. As members engage with the Wellframe app, their data is shared in real-time with their care team through the care team dashboard, which utilizes advanced algorithms to generate early intervention alerts. With secure two-way messaging, Wellframe facilitates long-term, trusted relationships between patients and care teams. Role Overview

Wellframe translates evidence-based, peer-reviewed guidelines and literature into an interactive daily checklist delivered to members through the Wellframe mobile app. As members engage with the Wellframe app, their data is shared in real-time with their care team through the care team dashboard, which utilizes advanced algorithms to generate early intervention alerts. With secure two-way messaging, Wellframe facilitates long-term, trusted relationships between patients and care teams. Role Overview
The Data Science team at Wellframe brings cutting-edge technologies to solve problems at the intersection of healthcare and technology. We work with large, multi-source datasets that include medical claims, mobile app, messaging and care management data.

We are seeking a Data Scientist to contribute to a growing body of insights from claims and platform usage data. This individual will play a critical role in measuring the value Wellframe generates for our customers as well as their members. S/he will contribute to member segmentation as well as insights generated from the mobile app usage and the care team dashboard.

We call it Digital Health Management. Our comprehensive suite of Digital Health Management solutions for care management, advocacy, and navigation help organizations forge more meaningful connections with members, across their healthcare journey.
Wellframe was founded to counter a pressing industry problem: the healthcare system has struggled to find ways to support people in between care settings, at scale. We believe health plans are in the best position to advocate for their members as they navigate their health and care, but know that technology alone can’t help us achieve this ambition. That’s why our team of physicians, clinicians, public health experts, data scientists, engineers, and healthcare industry experts ensure our patented technology works in service of the person-to-person connections that make healthcare work best.
Wellframe helps healthcare organizations support every aspect of health beyond the four walls of care delivery. We provide care transformation services, a patented engagement platform, clinical programs that support the clinical and social determinants of health, and rigorous measurement.
Wellframe translates evidence-based, peer-reviewed guidelines and literature into an interactive daily checklist delivered to members through the Wellframe mobile app. As members engage with the Wellframe app, their data is shared in real-time with their care team through the care team dashboard, which utilizes advanced algorithms to generate early intervention alerts. With secure two-way messaging, Wellframe facilitates long-term, trusted relationships between patients and care teams. Role Overview
The Data Science team at Wellframe brings cutting-edge technologies to solve problems at the intersection of healthcare and technology.

With secure two-way messaging, Wellframe facilitates long-term, trusted relationships between patients and care teams. Role Overview
The Data Science team at Wellframe brings cutting-edge technologies to solve problems at the intersection of healthcare and technology. We work with large, multi-source datasets that include medical claims, mobile app, messaging and care management data. Our mission is to gain 360-degree insights into members’ lives both within and outside of the healthcare system, and to use these insights to build a better digital healthcare product that is tailored for specific member populations.
We are seeking a Data Scientist to contribute to a growing body of insights from claims and platform usage data. This individual will play a critical role in measuring the value Wellframe generates for our customers as well as their members.

Our comprehensive suite of Digital Health Management solutions for care management, advocacy, and navigation help organizations forge more meaningful connections with members, across their healthcare journey.
Wellframe was founded to counter a pressing industry problem: the healthcare system has struggled to find ways to support people in between care settings, at scale.

With secure two-way messaging, Wellframe facilitates long-term, trusted relationships between patients and care teams. Role Overview
The Data Science team at Wellframe brings cutting-edge technologies to solve problems at the intersection of healthcare and technology. We work with large, multi-source datasets that include medical claims, mobile app, messaging and care management data.

We are seeking a Data Scientist to contribute to a growing body of insights from claims and platform usage data. This individual will play a critical role in measuring the value Wellframe generates for our customers as well as their members.

We call it Digital Health Management. Our comprehensive suite of Digital Health Management solutions for care management, advocacy, and navigation help organizations forge more meaningful connections with members, across their healthcare journey.
Wellframe was founded to counter a pressing industry problem: the healthcare system has struggled to find ways to support people in between care settings, at scale. We believe health plans are in the best position to advocate for their members as they navigate their health and care, but know that technology alone can’t help us achieve this ambition. That’s why our team of physicians, clinicians, public health experts, data scientists, engineers, and healthcare industry experts ensure our patented technology works in service of the person-to-person connections that make healthcare work best.
Wellframe helps healthcare organizations support every aspect of health beyond the four walls of care delivery. We provide care transformation services, a patented engagement platform, clinical programs that support the clinical and social determinants of health, and rigorous measurement.
Wellframe translates evidence-based, peer-reviewed guidelines and literature into an interactive daily checklist delivered to members through the Wellframe mobile app. As members engage with the Wellframe app, their data is shared in real-time with their care team through the care team dashboard, which utilizes advanced algorithms to generate early intervention alerts. With secure two-way messaging, Wellframe facilitates long-term, trusted relationships between patients and care teams. Role Overview
The Data Science team at Wellframe brings cutting-edge technologies to solve problems at the intersection of healthcare and technology. We work with large, multi-source datasets that include medical claims, mobile app, messaging and care management data. Our mission is to gain 360-degree insights into members’ lives both within and outside of the healthcare system, and to use these insights to build a better digital healthcare product that is tailored for specific member populations.
We are seeking a Data Scientist to contribute to a growing body of insights from claims and platform usage data. This individual will play a critical role in measuring the value Wellframe generates for our customers as well as their members. S/he will contribute to member segmentation as well as insights generated from the mobile app usage and the care team dashboard. Finally, s/he will help identify members that stand to benefit from particular interventions, as well as care team performance.

With secure two-way messaging, Wellframe facilitates long-term, trusted relationships between patients and care teams. Role Overview
The Data Science team at Wellframe brings cutting-edge technologies to solve problems at the intersection of healthcare and technology. We work with large, multi-source datasets that include medical claims, mobile app, messaging and care management data.

With secure two-way messaging, Wellframe facilitates long-term, trusted relationships between patients and care teams. Role Overview
The Data Science team at Wellframe brings cutting-edge technologies to solve problems at the intersection of healthcare and technology. We work with large, multi-source datasets that include medical claims, mobile app, messaging and care management data. Our mission is to gain 360-degree insights into members’ lives both within and outside of the healthcare system, and to use these insights to build a better digital healthcare product that is tailored for specific member populations.
We are seeking a Data Scientist to contribute to a growing body of insights from claims and platform usage data. This individual will play a critical role in measuring the value Wellframe generates for our customers as well as their members. S/he will contribute to member segmentation as well as insights generated from the mobile app usage and the care team dashboard.
